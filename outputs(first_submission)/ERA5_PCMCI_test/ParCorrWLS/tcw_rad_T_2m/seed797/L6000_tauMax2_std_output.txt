## Step 1: PC1 algorithm for selecting lagged conditions
##

Parameters:
independence test = par_corr_wls
tau_min = 1
tau_max = 2
pc_alpha = [0.4]
max_conds_dim = None
max_combinations = 1



## Resulting lagged parent (super)sets:

    Variable tcw has 2 link(s):
        (tcw -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.824
        (tcw -2): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.460

    Variable rad has 2 link(s):
        (rad -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.914
        (rad -2): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.707

    Variable T_2m has 2 link(s):
        (T_2m -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.882
        (T_2m -2): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.628

##
## Step 2: MCI algorithm
##

Parameters:

independence test = par_corr_wls
tau_min = 0
tau_max = 2
max_conds_py = None
max_conds_px = None

## Significant links at alpha = 0.05:

    Variable tcw has 3 link(s):
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.806
        (tcw -2): pval = 0.00000 | val = -0.308
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.101

    Variable rad has 4 link(s):
        (rad -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.879
        (rad -2): pval = 0.00000 | val = -0.510
        (T_2m  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.382 | unoriented link
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.114

    Variable T_2m has 5 link(s):
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.814
        (rad  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.382 | unoriented link
        (rad -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.240
        (T_2m -2): pval = 0.00000 | val = -0.178
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.089
