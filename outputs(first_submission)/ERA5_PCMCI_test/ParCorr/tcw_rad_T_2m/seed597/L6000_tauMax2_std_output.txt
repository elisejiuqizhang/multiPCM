## Step 1: PC1 algorithm for selecting lagged conditions
##

Parameters:
independence test = par_corr
tau_min = 1
tau_max = 2
pc_alpha = [0.4]
max_conds_dim = None
max_combinations = 1



## Resulting lagged parent (super)sets:

    Variable tcw has 2 link(s):
        (tcw -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.884
        (tcw -2): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.577

    Variable rad has 2 link(s):
        (rad -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.926
        (rad -2): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.732

    Variable T_2m has 1 link(s):
        (T_2m -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.796

##
## Step 2: MCI algorithm
##

Parameters:

independence test = par_corr
tau_min = 0
tau_max = 2
max_conds_py = None
max_conds_px = None

## Significant links at alpha = 0.05:

    Variable tcw has 2 link(s):
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.841
        (tcw -2): pval = 0.00000 | val = -0.348

    Variable rad has 3 link(s):
        (rad -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.912
        (rad -2): pval = 0.00000 | val = -0.566
        (T_2m  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.393 | unoriented link

    Variable T_2m has 5 link(s):
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.796
        (rad  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.393 | unoriented link
        (rad -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.352
        (rad -2): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.165
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.056
