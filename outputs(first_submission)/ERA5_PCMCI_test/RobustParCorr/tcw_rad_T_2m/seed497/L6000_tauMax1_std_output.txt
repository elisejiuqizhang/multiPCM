## Step 1: PC1 algorithm for selecting lagged conditions
##

Parameters:
independence test = robust_par_corr
tau_min = 1
tau_max = 1
pc_alpha = [0.4]
max_conds_dim = None
max_combinations = 1



## Resulting lagged parent (super)sets:

    Variable tcw has 1 link(s):
        (tcw -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.984

    Variable rad has 1 link(s):
        (rad -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.931

    Variable T_2m has 1 link(s):
        (T_2m -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.991

##
## Step 2: MCI algorithm
##

Parameters:

independence test = robust_par_corr
tau_min = 0
tau_max = 1
max_conds_py = None
max_conds_px = None

## Significant links at alpha = 0.05:

    Variable tcw has 4 link(s):
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.862
        (rad  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.111 | unoriented link
        (T_2m  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.095 | unoriented link
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.081

    Variable rad has 5 link(s):
        (rad -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.901
        (T_2m  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.497 | unoriented link
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.396
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.129
        (tcw  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.111 | unoriented link

    Variable T_2m has 5 link(s):
        (T_2m -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.817
        (rad  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.497 | unoriented link
        (rad -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.455
        (tcw -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.103
        (tcw  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.095 | unoriented link
