##
## Step 1: PC1 algorithm for selecting lagged conditions
##

Parameters:
independence test = cmi_knn
tau_min = 1
tau_max = 4
pc_alpha = [0.1]
max_conds_dim = None
max_combinations = 1



## Resulting lagged parent (super)sets:

    Variable X has 1 link(s):
        (Y -3): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.212

    Variable Y has 1 link(s):
        (Y -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.257

    Variable Z has 1 link(s):
        (Y -2): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.149

##
## Step 2: MCI algorithm
##

Parameters:

independence test = cmi_knn
tau_min = 0
tau_max = 4
max_conds_py = None
max_conds_px = None

## Significant links at alpha = 0.05:

    Variable X has 1 link(s):
        (Y -3): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.213

    Variable Y has 2 link(s):
        (Y -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.257
        (Z  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.060 | unoriented link

    Variable Z has 3 link(s):
        (Y -2): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.155
        (Y -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.115
        (Y  0): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.060 | unoriented link
