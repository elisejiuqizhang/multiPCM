##
## Step 1: PC1 algorithm for selecting lagged conditions
##

Parameters:
independence test = cmi_knn
tau_min = 1
tau_max = 4
pc_alpha = [0.1]
max_conds_dim = None
max_combinations = 1



## Resulting lagged parent (super)sets:

    Variable W has 1 link(s):
        (W -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.219

    Variable X has 1 link(s):
        (X -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.216

    Variable Y has 1 link(s):
        (Y -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.220

    Variable Z has 1 link(s):
        (Z -1): max_pval = 0.00000, |min_val| =  0.216

##
## Step 2: MCI algorithm
##

Parameters:

independence test = cmi_knn
tau_min = 0
tau_max = 4
max_conds_py = None
max_conds_px = None

## Significant links at alpha = 0.05:

    Variable W has 1 link(s):
        (W -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.219

    Variable X has 1 link(s):
        (X -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.216

    Variable Y has 1 link(s):
        (Y -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.220

    Variable Z has 1 link(s):
        (Z -1): pval = 0.00000 | val =  0.216
